#using script separate_phenotypes.py we separate all phenotypes from phenotype_patient column so there will be only one phenotype in each line, and we alsochange string "Developmental delay AND/OR other significant developmental or morphological phenotypes" in phenotype_patient column to string "Developmental delay", because for first string there is no corresponding term in HPO database

#then using scritp separate_genes.py we separate all genes from Gene_name column so there will be only one gene in each line

#using script phenoToSubgraph.py we add subgraph of HPO graph (represented as set of termIDs) to every line (to every phenotype)
